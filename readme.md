A gold mine of PowerShell build scripts!

## Warning
So far this is just a dump of random scripts from my projects.
There is a lot of good stuff in here but it isn't a cohesive whole.
Hopefully I'll get around to cleaning this up and organizing it better some day.

Also, you should be using [psake](http://github.com/psake/psake) for all of your builds.

## What's here
There are all kinds of helpers here, including but not limited to:

* Assembly versioning
* Web application builds and deployments
* ClickOnce builds and deployments
* XML configuration
* TeamCity unit test running
* Zip files and backups
* Starting and stopping IIS sites

Do what you want with it.
